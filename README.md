# assertX_Triangle_Area
In this assignment, you are going to write a Java program that reads in the data of some triangles from the input file, calculate the area of the triangles (valid triangles only), and write the calculation results to the output file.

INPUT FILE(triangles.txt)

In each row of the input file, there are exactly 3 positive floating-point numbers (separated by whitespaces), which are the 3 side lengths of a (possible) triangle.

You cannot assume (or guess) the number of triangles in the input file.  
In other words, no matter how many (possible) triangles are stored in the input file, your program should correctly process all of them.
